This code is used to develop a game in the C language. The code creates a graphical window using the Graphics Library, graphics.h, and 
then plays an interactive game on this window with a spaceship and enemies. The game responds to keyboard 
inputs (using the kbhit() and getch() functions) from the player.

Through functions, the specific components and logic of the game are as follows:

The functions drawPlayer(), drawBullet(int i), and drawEnemy(int i) are used to draw the spaceship, bullets, and 
enemies on the graphic screen.

The initializeGame() function sets the initial state of the game. It determines the starting position of the spaceship and randomly 
generates the starting positions of bullets and enemies.

The movePlayer(int direction) function controls the direction of the spaceship.

The fireBullet() function fires a bullet from the spaceship.

The moveBullets() and moveEnemies() functions control the movements of bullets and enemies.

The checkCollision() function checks for collisions between bullets and enemies and performs necessary actions if a collision occurs.

The displayGameOver() function draws a screen displaying the end of the game and the final score.

The main() function continuously calls these functions in a loop to keep the game running. While the game is ongoing, it receives 
input from the keyboard and performs appropriate actions. The game loop continues until the player's lives drop to zero. 
When lives reach zero, the displayGameOver() function is called to show the end of the game, and the game loop terminates.
